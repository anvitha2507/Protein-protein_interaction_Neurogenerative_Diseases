# Protein-protein_interaction_Neurogenerative_Diseases
**Overview**
This repository contains code for predicting protein-protein interactions (PPI) associated with neurodegenerative diseases. The project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze molecular data and predict potential interactions between proteins involved in neurodegenerative processes.

**Features**

**Machine Learning Model:**Utilizes advanced machine learning models for predicting protein-protein interactions.

**Neurodegenerative Disease Focus:** Tailored for predicting interactions specifically associated with neurodegenerative diseases.


**Neurodegenerative Diseases**
The focus of this project includes but is not limited to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,Multiple sclerosis,Frontotemporal dementia,Lewy body dementia	,Vascular dementia diseases.
